This is a very simple program using Restricted-Hartree-Fock(RHF) method to treat hydrogen molecule system with sto-3g basis. In this program, I uses a little trick. Instead of using unitary transformation to deal with the problem of non-orthogonal basis, I directly multiplied the inverse matrix of overlap matrix by Fock matrix. This program was written three years ago, and I am planning to write a complete version of Hartree-Fock program now.
